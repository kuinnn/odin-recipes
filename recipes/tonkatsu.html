    <h2>Delicious friend Tonkatsu with cabbage and Goma Salad Dressing</h2>
    <p>Tonkatsu is a deep fried Japanese pork cutlet and is one of the most popular Japanese dishes. The pork loin or pork medallion is dipped into a batter of flour and egg, coated with breadcrumbs, deep-fried and then served in a multitude of ways. 
    The combination of the juicy pork and crunchy texture of the breadcrumbs is very addictive.'Ton' means pork in Japanese while the 'katsu' originally came from the English 'cutlet' or French 'cotelette'.</p>

    <p>Tonkatsu is most commonly served at tonkatsu restaurants, although it can be found in most Japanese restaurants. 
        The most popular restaurants often have quite long queues out front during the lunch hour, thanks to these dishes. 
        To get the most out of your first experience with tonkatsu, you should definitely order the teishoku (set meal), which comes with shredded cabbage, rice, miso (*1) soup and Japanese pickles.</p>
